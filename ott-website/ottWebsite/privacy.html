            <p>This Privacy Statement explains how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you use the "Netflix service” to access “Netflix content” as those terms are defined in the Netflix Terms of Use (netflix.com/terms). It also explains what privacy rights you have and how to exercise them. Certain functionalities or apps that are part of the Netflix service may also provide you with contextual privacy information or choices, in addition to the information and choices described in this Privacy Statement. Please note that this Privacy Statement may be easier to navigate when viewed on your web browser.</p>

                <p>For questions about this Privacy Statement, our use of your personal information, or how to exercise your privacy rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer/Privacy Office at <span class="text-danger"> privacy@netflix.com.</span> For general questions about the Netflix service, your account, or how to contact customer service, please visit help.netflix.com.<br><br>

                    Information about the specific Netflix entity (or entities) that are responsible for your personal information (known as the “data controller” in certain countries) is available at<span class="text-danger">  netflix.com/legal/corpinfo.</span> </p>
                <h4 id="list-item-2" class="fw-bold">Section A: Our Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Personal Information</h4>
                <p><span>The Categories of Personal Information We Collect</span>
                   <span class="fw-bold">  We collect the following categories of personal information about you:</span><br><br>
                    
                    <span class="fw-bold">Personal Details:</span> When you create your Netflix account, we collect your contact information (such as your email address) and authentication information for your login (such as a password). Depending on how you subsequently set up your account and method of payment, and which features you use, we also collect one or more of the following: first and last name, phone number, postal address, and other identifiers you provide to us. If you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan, we also collect gender and date of birth.<br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Payment Details:</span> We collect your payment details, and other information to process your payments, including your payment history, billing address, and gift cards you have redeemed.<br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Netflix account/profile information:</span> We collect information that is associated with your Netflix account and/or Netflix profiles on your account (such as profile name and icon, Netflix game handle, ratings and feedback you provide for Netflix content), “My List” (watch list of titles), “continue watching” information, account/profile settings, and choices in connection with your use of the Netflix service.<br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Uses Information:</span> We collect information about your interaction with the Netflix service (including playback events, such as play, pause, etc.), choices made when engaging with interactive titles, your Netflix game activity (such as gameplay, game use and interaction information, and progress or saved game information), Netflix viewing and gaming history, search queries on the Netflix service, and other information about your use and interaction with the Netflix service (such as app clicks, text input, time and duration of access, and camera/photo access for QR-code and similar functionality).
                    Advertising information: If you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan, we collect information about the ads on Netflix (“Advertisements,” as defined in the Netflix Terms of Use) that you view or interact with, device information (such as resettable device identifiers), IP addresses, and information provided by Advertising Companies (such as information about your likely interests they have collected or inferred from your visits to other websites and apps). We use this information to display Advertisements to you in the Netflix service (including behavioral advertisements in accordance with your preferences).</p>
                <h4 id="list-item-3" class="fw-bold">Communication and Marketing Preferences</h4>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">Email and Text messages:</span> If you no longer want to receive certain communications from us via email or text message, please access the “Notification settings” option for the relevant profile within the “Account” section of our website. Alternatively, click the “unsubscribe” link in the email or reply STOP (or as otherwise instructed) to the text message (note: you may receive a confirmation text message in this case). Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from transactional messages from us, such as messages relating to your account transactions.<br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Push notification:</span> You can choose to receive mobile push notifications from Netflix. Netflix will send you push notifications from time to time in accordance with any notification preferences you have set on your mobile device. If you later decide you no longer want to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device’s settings to turn them off (or via the “Notification settings” described in the preceding section). <br><br>Please note that individual Netflix games may have their own push notifications (you can use your mobile device's settings functionality to turn them off). We also offer push notifications on certain web browsers. If you agree to receive those notifications and later decide you no longer want to receive them, you can use your browser’s settings to turn them off.<br><br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Matched Identifier Communications from Netflix:</span>. Some third party services allow us to reach users with online marketing about Netflix content or the Netflix service by sending privacy protected contact information to the third party. Privacy protected contact information means we use deidentification technologies to convert the original contact information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value (typically a long alphanumeric sequence of characters) to keep the original information from being revealed. The third party compares Netflix’s privacy protected contact information with privacy protected contact information in its own database and there will be a match only if you have used the same contact information with Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send Netflix marketing to you on that third party service, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of such marketing. You can indicate your choices in the “Privacy and data settings” (for the relevant profile) within the “Account” section of our website.<br><br>
                    Marketing of the Netflix service using cookies and similar technologies. To exercise choice around cookies or resettable device IDs collected for marketing of the Netflix service or Netflix content on third party service, please use the tools described in the “Cookies and Internet Advertising” section below.</p>
                <h4 id="list-item-4" class="fw-bold">Your Rights and Controls</h4>
                <p>
                    <h5>Your Privacy Rights</h5>
                    <span class="fw-bold"> Access, correct, update, or delete your personal information:</span> You have a right to confirm whether we process your personal information and to access and receive a copy of the personal information we process about you. You may also correct or update out-of-date or inaccurate personal information or request that we delete personal information that we hold about you.<br>
                    To request a copy of your personal information, please visit netflix.com/account/getmyinfo. In addition, under the "Account" section of our website, you can access and update information about your account, including your contact information, payment information, and various related information about your account. You must be logged in to access the "Account" section.<br><br>
                    For information about deletion, removal, and retention of personal information, please see: help.netflix.com/node/100625.<br>
                    Portability and downloading a copy of your personal information: You can request portability of or download a copy of your personal information. If you are the account owner, to download a copy of your personal information go to: netflix.com/account/getmyinfo. For more information, please see: help.netflix.com/node/100624.<br><br>
                    Objection, restriction, and withdrawal of consent: You can object to or request that we restrict processing of your personal information. If we have collected and are processing your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. For more information, please see help.netflix.com/node/100637.<br><br>
                    Right to complain: You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our processing of your personal information but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns.
                    Right not to be subject to automated decision making: You may have a right not to be subject to a decision made solely using automated means, where such decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.</p>
                <h4 id="list-item-4">Access to Account and Profiles</h4>
                <p>Sharing your account with others: As a Netflix member, if you share your account with others in your household, please ensure that they are aware of and have read this Privacy Statement. This Privacy Statement applies to their use of Netflix (except sections that only apply to the member, such as those related to payments). Please note that the member controls the Netflix account and all profiles, the information in the account and all profiles, and whether to share (or stop sharing) the account with individuals in their household.<br><br>
                    If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they may be able to see viewing information, account information in the “Account” section of the service, and game related information such as chat contents and saved game information. This remains true even when you use the profiles feature, although you can add a Profile Lock PIN on a profile (see help.netflix.com/node/114277). Please note that viewing history, recommendations, “continue watching” and similar information may be made available through various features and user experiences, such as Partner interfaces that are integrated with the Netflix service.<br><br>
                    Profiles: Profiles allow users on a Netflix account to have a personalized Netflix experience, built around the Netflix content of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. Please note that profiles are available to everyone who uses your Netflix account, so that anyone with access to your Netflix account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles, and information within or associated with the profile (although, as noted above, you can add a Profile Lock PIN on a profile). You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not want them to use or change your profile, be sure to let them know. Profile users may be offered the opportunity to add an email address, phone number, or other information to the profile and will be provided with a notice at the time such information is provided (the “Profile Privacy Notice” applies – see help.netflix.com/legal/profileprivacy). We also have various parental controls available and you can learn more here: help.netflix.com/node/264.</p>
                <h4 id="list-item-4"class="fw-bold">Other Important Privacy Disclosures</h4>
                <p>certain portions of our service may give you options to share information by email, text message, and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and apps on your device; and
                    social plugins and similar technologies that allow you to share information.<br><br>
                    Social plugins and social applications are operated by third-party social networks, and are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies. Similarly, some Netflix game features may require use of a third party service, which is subject to that service’s terms of use and privacy policy.<br><br>
                    
                   <span class="fw-bold"> Security</span>
                    We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical, and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, use and modification. These measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risks of processing your personal information.
                    
                    <span class="fw-bold"> Retention of Personal Information</span>
                    We may retain personal information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your choices, for our billing or records purposes, and as otherwise necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.
                    
                    Specifically, we retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide our service; to administer and operate our business; to research, analyze, and improve our services; to operate our ad supported subscription plan; for safety, security, and fraud prevention; and to comply with law and enforce our Terms of Use. Our retention of personal information is based on many factors such as your relationship with Netflix (for example, whether you are a current Netflix member), the nature of the personal information, our legal obligations, and the need to defend or resolve current or anticipated legal claims.
                    
                    We take reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required. For information about deletion, removal, and retention of personal information, please see: help.netflix.com/node/100625.</p>
